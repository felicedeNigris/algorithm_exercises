#Enqueue & Dequeue a list(array)

###Create an enqueue function which takes items starting from the beginning of an array and puts them into a new array. In the new array the item that was once in the beginning is not the last item. Then write a dequeue function which takes the items from the list starting from the beginning and pushing the items to a new array. The first item will now be the last item.

> ['c','b','a'] turns into ['a','b','c']
