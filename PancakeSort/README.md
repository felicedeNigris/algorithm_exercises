Given an array of integers, sort the array using a given Flip operation.
This is called Pancake sorting because this uses Flip operation which is analogous to flipping pancakes.
For example, if there are 5 pancakes stacked one of top of the other, then Flip operation is when a spatula is inserted at any point in the stack and then turned upside down flipping all pancakes above it.

Flip operation is defined on the array as:
flip(array, end) = reverse the array elements from 0 to end (inclusive)
Example:
Consider the array:
array[] = {4,1,2,5,3}
